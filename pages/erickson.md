This is a story of slow learning, of coming to know things that others certainly already knew. It's offered in the spirit of accountability and documentation, rather than with any claims to originality or novel insight. 

I first met Wadleigh through long-time school librarian and community advocate Paul McIntosh. And through Mr. McIntosh, I met Wadleigh's yearbooks. Paging through copies he guarded in a separate closet off the school library, I saw texts that represented school, Harlem, and Black children differently than I had seen before. Sitting as I did outside of Wadleigh's community but in relationship to many current and future teachers and educators at Teachers College, the potential power of these documents captivated me. What if these were the images and stories that shaped their thinking about what schooling in Harlem for Black children had been, was, and could be? Digitization of these resources was a way to put them, and their power, into more hands. 

Whose hands were they in already, though? And would they want to share? Maybe like others who back their way into digital projects in the humanities, I read about other work in the field partially and in fragments. This was no well-curated syllabus of foundational texts, but a meandering around projects that negotiated challenging questions and narrated that experience for others, generously. It was 2013, 2014, 2015. Projects like Mukurtu and the Reciprocal Research Network, coming out of Indigenous community work and traditions, asked not only how to put history online, but for whose use. Some material needed to be see only by people within its community of origin. Feminist work by Michelle Moravec and others asked how digital access could do harm of different sorts, to privacy of individuals and to the spaces they had built for themselves. These texts among others required the question of whether Wadleigh community members would want these documents of theirs online. The fact that they had originated as semi-public representations of the school in part for those outside of it (as parents, community supporters, students future selves) provided only a partial answer. Deborah Lucas Davis, the main organizer of Wadleigh's alumni network offered another one. She couldn't imagine any harm, but did think it would help take the pressure of her, to make periodic photocopies for alumni who requested them. 

Beyond avoiding harm in digitization, projects like the RRN raised other questions in the vein of "digital repatriation." The RRN gathered together materials across (white settler-controlled) museums to rejoin them and put them closer to the hands of the Native peoples who originated them. Digital repatriation didn't work as a metaphor for material already living in the Wadleigh library, but it did work for those texts that were about Wadleigh, or other Harlem schools, that now lived (behind several layers of literal and affective gatekeeping and exclusion) in Columbia's Rare Books and Manuscripts Library or the Columbia University Archive, rather than in Harlem. 

Reconnection, engagements previously impossible now made possible. I think a lot of ideas about that animated other digitization efforts I saw online at the time. Many put a comment or Disqus box at the bottom of each page of a digitized item, as if there was conversation this paper rendered pixels would animate. Not so different, in some respects, from how I thought about the Wadleigh yearbooks and the TC students and teachers I thought would encounter them. 

But of course that idea of a _new_ connection, a _new_ conversation, can ignore or even silence an old one. There was plenty of conversation around the Wadleigh yearbooks, within the alumni community itself. These documents weren't sparks of potential connection, but loci of existing communities.

## Against the university's hold 

Wadleigh's history has been at the center of my digital work since my introduction to Wadleigh in 2013. But its current digital manifestation is different than earlier versions in a few key ways. The first digital material that the Harlem Education History Project worked with in volume were Wadleigh yearbooks. This was an easy one - these were texts that community members within the school valued dearly, as their appearance in peoples' hands at the annual alumni party attested, but that others outside could learn from. They were public texts - designed to speak both within and outside the school (to family members, to students' future selves) and thus did not risk exposing what should not be exposed. And maybe having them online would help. Deborah Lucas Davis told me she was tired of making photocopies when alumni asked for them, and agreed that they could be digitized and shared online without doing harm. I used $3,000 dollars of my Teachers College research budget to pay the New York Public Library to digitize those yearbooks they held, and I went to Wadleigh (alongside my intrepid teen daughter and a doctoral student, Barry Goldenberg) on a sweaty June day and improvised a book-scanning station in the Wadleigh library for those that the NYPL did not have. (A few others, provided alumni community members, have been added since.)

The digital copies went to this project's first website, hosted on a Columbia University server, built with the content management system Omeka, and with a yellow and blue project logo on a white background. The logo read "Educating Harlem," the name that my colleague Ernest Morrell gave our shared project in our early conversations. Wadleigh's history was surrounded, at least, subsumed or extracted, at worst, within intended and unintended references to the university's perspectives and agendas. 

In 2018, we changed the project name. Deborah Lucas Davis pointed out the problem in a gathering of alumni and team members on this project in 2017. Who was Columbia to claim to "educate Harlem?" Too many old injustices, too many visible colonial practices, and too many ongoing ones, not to have that name be at minimum a distraction. Her critique lead to a set of conversations with partners inside and outside of the university, and I settled on renaming the whole endeavor the Harlem Education History Project. The Omeka site stayed on the Columbia server, the white background stayed, but under new more neutral text. 

[Book, online, chapter] [What the book argues; what's a digital project that works in line with what the book argues?]

In 2021, someone hacked the Columbia University Library server that hosted this project and a few others. Although their original commitment to this project conveyed interest in long-term open-access resources, Columbia Libraries colleagues decided not to invest in rebuilding the site. That break interrupted access to these materials for Wadleigh community members and students, but it also created an opportunity to reconfigure the digital, to try to carve a space out for Wadleigh's history to be facilitated by university resoures but operating on the terms that Wadleigh community members set. A separate website for Wadleigh (and each of the partner schools), with a Harlem Education History Project website serving as a hub, one way to access this history but not the only one. No Teachers College or Columbia logos. 

This transition or correction played out in other areas as well. Oral histories moved into the hands of students in Wadleigh's classrooms today, and alumni started asking about opportunities to interview one another. Classes opened to Wadleigh community members (Schomburg visit). Community members thought about parts of the school's history that needed recognition, and whether those could be visible on the website. [And defined decision-making authority in the hands of those closes to Wadleigh's past and present].
