## The Need for Inclusive Curriculum 

[image - Bulletin Board Displayed in 1985 "Wadleigh Way" yearbook]

_Our struggle has been not to get separate courses or to have one Negro History Week, but to get placing of the history and contribution of the Negro in every leel of social studies, literature, and science wherever it naturally comes. We want this written into our courses of study for all the children of our city -- to engender pride for the Negro child and appreciation for the white child." 
-Lucille Spence, Negro History Week Supplement 1954 

Lucille Spence, a biology teacher at the Wadleigh High School in Central Harlem beginning in the 1920s, was devoted to the integration of Black history in schools.  She worked with the New York Teachers Union to increase the presence of Negro history in the curriculum.   In 1935, Spence formed the Harlem Committee of the Teachers Union to improve the conditions of the schools.  This committee, later renamed the Anti-discrimination Committee, provided in-service workshops on Black history and race relations for teachers. The committee also created supplemental materials on Black history to distribute to schools throughout the country.  In addition the Teachers Union studied bias in New York City school textbooks.  These efforts ended when the organization disbanded in 1960.  However, the need for Black history in schools still remained.  

[Add a few sentence on the long history of advocacy for Black history.] 

In 1964, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited Inc. (HARYOU) published a report about the conditions of schools in Central Harlem.  This report titled “Youth in the Ghetto: A Study of the Consequences of Powerlessness and a Blueprint for Change” painted a dismal picture of the condition of Harlem schools: “The basic story of academic achievement in Central Harlem is one of inefficiency, inferiority and mass deterioration”.  This report also called attention to the fact that schools in Central Harlem had at the least a 89% Black student population, if not more. The segregation of schools in Central Harlem played a crucial role in the academic performance of these schools.  It also played a role in shaping the solutions to ensure all students had equal educational opportunities.   One of the changes the HARYOU report called for was the inclusion of Black history in the curriculum.  The report claimed  “that the self-image of the Negro youngsters is damaged by the school’s failure to integrate Negro history and personages into the regular classroom syllabus”. The insufficient inclusion of Black history and literature in classrooms was detrimental for students’ academic success.  Including stories that students could relate to, and more than just once a year during Negro History Week, was still seen as a necessity for student success.

When Lucille Spence started teaching at Wadleigh, it was an all girls high school with a multiracial student body.  Wadleigh closed in 1954 and reopened in 1957 as a coeducational junior high school.  When it reopened the student population at Wadleigh Junior High School were predominantly black students from the Central Harlem neighborhood.  This exhibit focuses on the inclusion of Black studies at Wadleigh in the 1970s and 1980s.

Was Black history integrated into Wadleigh Junior High School’s curriculum, and if so how?.  How did Black history at Wadleigh compare to what was being taught in other schools across the country? Black history and culture was part of the educational experience at Wadleigh Junior High School, both as part of the general curriculum as well as in supplemental programs such as Black history events.   

## Partial American History: Inclusion in the Social Studies 

[Image - Black History and the Schools - from 1968 Ebony article]

In the December 1968 issue of Ebony Magazine, Charles Harrison made a call to action for the inclusion of Black history.  This article argues that not only is Black history important for Black students, but without including it in social studies classes, all students are receiving an incomplete history of the United States.  Regardless of the racial make up of the school, Harrison argued, Black history is crucial to understanding the history of the country as well as for fostering better relations between races in the present.  The article claimed that although elective courses and supplemental materials on Black history were  a start, they were not enough.  To make a real difference, this history has to be seamlessly incorporated with the other half of American history.  At the end of the article it lists which states include Black history in the curriculum and gives a small summary of how this is done. This article shows that the inclusion of Black history was an important issue in the 1960s. It was gaining more attention by historians and teachers. Not only was it important to teach Black history to Black students to help cultivate their own positive self-image. It was important to teach it to all students in order to create a more equal America.  

## Social Studies at Wadleigh

Evidence found in yearbooks, handbooks and other school handouts prove that Black history was part of the social studies curriculum at Wadleigh.  The 1971 Wadleigh Way yearbook features an interview with Wadleigh student, Gloria Lundy and social studies teacher Miss. Violenus.  From this interview it is revealed that in 1971 social studies classes at Wadleigh included classes in current events, the history and the future of cities, and Black history.

These classes all were relevant to the lives of students at Wadleigh.  Current events were an important class to help students be aware of world events and understand these better.  The yearbook interview mentioned how the purpose of current events was for students to “learn how to improve their living conditions.”  Teaching current events gave the students agency.  Similarly, the history and futures of cites sounds like a class that would also directly relate to students living in Harlem.  The third class mentioned was Black History in the Social Studies.

Like Lucille Spence, Charles Harrison’s Ebony article also claimed that Black history should not be a separate class, but rather included in the American history narrative.  From the short description in the yearbook it is hard to know exactly how this class was structured.  The captions next to the pictures describe classes learning about The Civil War and Reconstruction.  This could possibly mean that students were revisiting familiar parts of US history from Black perspectives.  This yearbook page demonstrates that Black history was being incorporating into the social studies curriculum at Wadleigh.  This functions both to provide positive self-image for the students and to provide a full history of the United States.

The “Social Studies” page in the 1975 Wadleigh Way also mentions the importance of social studies classes for students to better understand their past and improve their future.  This page does not mention the same classes that were discussed in the 1971 yearbook.  Instead, the 1975 yearbook page described an Ethnic Studies Program.  This program is one where the “customs, traditions and contributions of all ethnic groups are emphasized”.  It  does not specifically mention Black history on this page.  It is hard to know exactly how much Black history was taught in Wadleigh social studies classes in 1975 from this page. However, based on the student population and the previous emphasis on teaching Black history, it very likely that Black history was still present.  

This inclusion of ethnic studies is something had become more common in New York Schools.  A 1961 report from the commissioner of education in New York state discussed the need for ethnic studies classes in the social studies curriculum, “ special importance if the inclusion of the cultures of the so-called non-western world”.  The report helps to show some level of state support for ethnic studies at Wadleigh.

This list of homework requirements at Wadleigh also shows the presence of Black history at Wadleigh.  This list was not dated but, as we can tell from the letterhead, was written during the time Elfreda Wright was principal of Wadleigh, between 1971 and 1982.  Homework required for different subjects is listed from book reports for English to science experiments. “Black history” and “minority studies” are listed as kinds of homework, alongside “creative writing and science experiments, among others.  For social studies, it lists homework for current events, map and globe studies, Black history and minority studies.  Though the document does not provide more information about homework on Black history, the fact that is was listed with the other social studies assignments shows that Black history included in the studies at Wadleigh.
